### Tencent
- Tencent
- November 11, 1998, Cayman Islands
- Headquarters: Shenzhen, China
- Founders: Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Chen Yidan, kney, daniel
- Tencent operates as one of the largest video game vendors globally and also owns the Chinese social networks and messaging platforms WeChat and Tencent QQ. Both these areas are essential to the development of the metaverse. For example, Tencent QQ already offers gaming, e-commerce, music, films, and voice chat capabilities all within its web portal. WeChat provides a mobile payment app that can link to its social media platforms. This ties into their stake in Epic Games, the producers of Fortnite, and Riot Games, publisher of League of Legends. For these reasons, Tencent will likely use video games as their niche in the metaverse.
